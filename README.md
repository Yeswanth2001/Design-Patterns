### What is Design Patterns?
- Design patterns provide general solution for solving the specific task/problem in software design.
- They represent best practices and provide templates for solving particular issues in efficient manner.
- Using design pattern, you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintable.

### Why we need Design Pattern?
- Provide proven solutions to common problems.
- Make code reusable, saving time and effort.
- Help create software that is easier to understand and maintain.
- Foster collaboration and communication among developers.
- Improve the quality and scalability of software systems.

### Types of Design Patterns:
1. Creational Design Pattern
2. Structural Design Pattern
3. Behavioural Design Pattern

#### What is Creational Design Pattern?
- Creational desing pattern deals with object creation and initialization.
- It create object based on use case and try to make it more flexible and efficient.
- Using this desing pattern, reduce the complexity of object creation and provide best possbile way to reuse it.
- Eg : Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype etc...

#### What is Structural Design Pattern?
- It focus on the blueprint for organizing classes and object to form larger structure and make complex structure more flexible and reusable.
- Eg : Adapter, Bridge, Decorator, Facade & Proxy etc...

#### What is Behavioural Design Pattern?
- Behavioural Design Pattern deals with the communication between object and classes.
- They focus on how objects and classes collaborate and communicate to accomplish task and responsiblities.
- Eg : Strategy, Observer etc ...
